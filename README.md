#Chicago Crime Dataset

Repository includes all the analysis that I have done on the Chicago Crime Dataset using Big Data technologies like Hadoop, Map Reduce, Hbase, Hive.

The dataset contains approximately 10 million records. The data was not clean hence used python to clean the dataset and later uploaded the dataset on Hadoop File System where Map Reduce jobs were written for conducting different analysis.

The repository also contains a documentation on all the analysis performed and results of those analysis.
